# Coronavirus Analysis and Graphs

This repo contains two Jupyter Notebooks with analysis of some coronavirus data and 2) some Javascript that creates [plots](https://gussies.website.org/corona_graphs.html) of that data.

## 1) Analysis of population density's relationship to infection rates

Click this badge to see some analysis [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/joncheryl/corona-graphs/master?filepath=coronavirus-density-analysis.ipynb). If you open the notebook on binder and run it yourself, the analysis is up-to-date with the latest data.

### Sources
The data is from the [NYTimes github](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) and I scrapped population data from census.gov (specific locales in Python scripts).

## 2) Study of data from Google Mobility Reports

In [this notebook](http://gussies.website/mobility_report_part_1.html), I try to find some relationships between changes in mobility and coronavirus infection rates.

### Sources

- [Google Mobility Reports](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/)

## 2) Plots of coronavirus data

A [collection](https://gussies.website.org/corona_graphs.html) of graphics for analysing the amount of testing for infection in each state.

### Sources

The main data is from https://covidtracking.com/ and I pulled population data (for calculating per-capita statistics) off of Wikipedia or something.
